They’re excited about their new venture and eager to get started. Unfortunately, many new businesses fail within the first few years. Marketing consultants can come across as a self-serving sales pitch when pitching their services to potential clients. While consultants may think they have the solution to their clients’ problems, clients may see things differently after being bombarded with information from consultants who have no incentive other than to close the sale. Here are some common marketing consultant pitfalls to avoid so that you don’t end up in the same boat as so many other new businesses that struggle to find success:</p><h2>Don’t focus on features.</h2><p>As a consultant, you’re not selling a product. Instead, you’re solving a problem. Focusing on features won’t help you solve a client’s problem. Instead, you need to focus on benefits. What is in it for your client? What does it do for them? What does it solve? What does it prevent? What is the value proposition?</p><h2>Don’t be a know-it-all.</h2><p>As a marketing consultant, you may think you know everything. However, your clients don’t care about your experience or how much you know. All they care about is how you can help them. Stay humble and remember that you’re there to help your clients. If you try to talk down to your clients or sound like you know everything, you’ll come across as arrogant and end up losing the sale. Instead, focus on listening to your clients and finding out what they need.</p><h2>Don’t promise too much.</h2><p>Many marketing consultants make the mistake of promising too much. They promise too many leads and too many clients. They promise too many leads because they don’t understand the difference between a lead and a sale. They promise too many clients because they don’t understand their client’s needs. If you promise too much, you’ll end up with a ton of leads and clients who don’t need what you have to offer.</p><h2>Don’t talk about price.</h2><p>Many marketing consultants talk about price before they’ve even met with a client. They assume that the person is going to hire them and that they’ll be able to charge a certain amount. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. You might think you can charge $5,000 per month, but your client may only be willing to pay $2,000 per month. If you don’t understand the client’s needs, you may not be able to charge what you think you can charge. Instead, focus on finding out what your client needs and then figuring out how much you can charge for those services.</p><h2>Don’t forget about your clients’ needs.</h2><p>As a marketing consultant, you have to remember that you’re there to help your clients. You can’t just push your services on them. It’s important to understand your clients’ needs and then figure out how you can help them. That means you have to understand their business and their industry. You have to understand what their goals are and how you can help them achieve them. You have to understand their problems and find a way to solve them. If you don’t remember your clients’ needs and focus on helping them instead of pitching your services, you may not get the business.</p><h2>Bottom line</h2><p>Marketing consultants can come across as self-serving sales pitches. It’s important to remember that you’re there to help your clients, not sell them on your services. Stay focused on your clients and their needs, and you’ll avoid the marketing consultant pitfalls listed above.</p>
